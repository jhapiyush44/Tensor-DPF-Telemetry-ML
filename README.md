# Vehicle Telemetry ML Pipeline

A complete end-to-end Machine Learning system that generates synthetic vehicle telemetry data, performs advanced feature engineering, trains predictive models, and deploys them via a FastAPI inference service. This pipeline predicts soot load levels and regeneration requirements for vehicle exhaust systems.

---

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a clean, modular architecture with four main stages:

```
Data Generation → Feature Engineering → Model Training → API Deployment
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓                ↓
generate_data.py  feature_engineering.py    train.py      uvicorn (FastAPI)
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓                ↓
CSV files         Parquet features       Trained models    HTTP endpoints
```

**Data Flow:**
1. **Data Generation** (`generate_data.py`): Creates synthetic telemetry, maintenance, and trip data
2. **Feature Engineering** (`feature_engineering.py`): Transforms raw data into ML-ready features
3. **Model Training** (`train.py`): Trains RandomForest models for regression and classification
4. **API Deployment** (`api/app.py`): Serves real-time predictions with FastAPI

---

## Data Generation Explanation

The data generation module creates realistic vehicle telemetry data simulating multiple vehicles over an extended period.

**Configuration Parameters:**
- **N_VEHICLES**: 30 vehicles in the fleet
- **DAYS**: 90 days of historical data
- **FREQ**: 1-minute measurement frequency (measurements taken every minute)

**Total Rows Calculation:**
```
Rows per vehicle = DAYS × Hours per day × Minutes per hour
Rows per vehicle = 90 × 24 × 60 = 129,600 rows
Total dataset = 129,600 rows × 30 vehicles = 3,888,000 rows (~3.9M)
```

**Generated Files:**

| File | Purpose | Rows | Columns |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| `telemetry.csv` | Raw sensor measurements (pressure, temperature, emissions) | ~3.9M | 8 |
| `maintenance.csv` | Maintenance events and schedules | Variable | 5 |
| `trips.csv` | Trip-level aggregations with distance and duration | ~2,700 | 6 |

These files form the foundation for feature engineering and model training.

---

## Memory/RAM Optimization

The default configuration (30 vehicles, 90 days, 1-minute frequency) requires moderate computational resources. Use this guide to adjust data generation parameters based on your available RAM.

**Recommended Configurations by Available RAM:**

| RAM | Vehicles | Days | Frequency | Total Rows | Notes |
|-----|----------|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **16GB** | 30 | 90 | 1 min | 3.9M | Full dataset, recommended |
| **16GB** | 50 | 90 | 1 min | 6.5M | Large-scale testing |
| **8GB** | 15 | 90 | 1 min | 1.95M | Comfortable processing |
| **8GB** | 10 | 60 | 1 min | 864K | Conservative approach |
| **4GB** | 5 | 30 | 5 min | 216K | Minimal dataset |
| **4GB** | 10 | 7 | 10 min | 100.8K | Very limited resources |

**How to Adjust:**
Edit the configuration in `data_generation/generate_data.py`:

```python
N_VEHICLES = 30  # Reduce to 15 or 10
DAYS = 90        # Reduce to 30 or 60
FREQ = "1min"    # Change to "5min" or "10min"
```

**General Guidelines:**
- Reducing `DAYS` has the largest impact on dataset size
- Increasing `FREQ` (e.g., from 1 min to 5 min) reduces rows by 5x
- Start conservative and increase if you have headroom

## Clean Restart Instructions

If you need to reset the pipeline and regenerate all data, follow these steps to clean your workspace completely.

**Why Clean Restart is Necessary:**
- Old data files may contain obsolete schemas or configurations
- Cached model artifacts can cause loading errors with updated feature sets
- Parquet format can cache schema information, causing conflicts
- Starting fresh ensures reproducibility and prevents subtle bugs

**Clean Restart Steps:**

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell

# Delete generated data files
Remove-Item -Path "data\*.csv" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "data\*.parquet" -Force

# Delete trained models
Remove-Item -Path "models\*.pkl" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "models\*.joblib" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "models\metrics.json" -Force

# Verify cleanup
Get-ChildItem -Path data\
Get-ChildItem -Path models\
```

**Linux/Mac Equivalent:**

```bash
# Delete generated data files
rm -f data/*.csv data/*.parquet

# Delete trained models
rm -f models/*.pkl models/*.joblib models/metrics.json

# Verify cleanup
ls -la data/
ls -la models/
```

After cleanup, proceed with fresh data generation (see **Step-by-Step Pipeline Commands** below).

---

## Setup Instructions

Before running the pipeline, set up your Python environment with all required dependencies.

**Step 1: Create Virtual Environment**

**Windows:**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment**

Verify your virtual environment is active (you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt).

**Step 3: Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing & CI (Continuous Integration)

To ensure API correctness without committing model artifacts to GitHub, the test suite dynamically generates lightweight dummy models.

The CI workflow will:
- create dummy RandomForest models if none are present
- validate API responses
- run unit and integration tests

This ensures:
✔ CI builds quickly  
✔ tests simulate production behavior  
✔ no large binaries (.pkl) are stored in source control

Add this to `.gitignore`:
```
models/.pkl
models/metrics.json
data/
```


### Interactive API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive Swagger documentation:
- **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc

Use these interfaces to test endpoints directly from your browser with auto-complete and request validation.

## Design Decisions

This section explains key architectural and technical choices made in the system design.

### Why Apache Parquet for Features?

**Decision:** Store engineered features in Parquet format instead of CSV

**Rationale:**
- **Compression:** Parquet reduces file size by 70-80% compared to CSV (4GB → 0.8GB)
- **Performance:** 10-50x faster read times for analytical queries
- **Type Safety:** Preserves data types (float32, int64) without re-parsing
- **Columnar Storage:** Enables efficient feature subset loading
- **Streaming:** Supports lazy evaluation for large datasets

**Trade-off:** Requires `pyarrow` dependency; not human-readable. Mitigated by using CSV for raw data (easier inspection).

### Why Time-Based Train/Test Split?

**Decision:** Split data by timestamp (80% earlier data, 20% recent data) instead of random split

**Rationale:**
- **Realistic Evaluation:** Simulates real-world scenario where you train on historical data and predict future
- **Prevents Data Leakage:** Temporal dependencies within vehicle trips stay together
- **Trend Detection:** Tests model's ability to handle temporal patterns
- **Maintenance Cycles:** Captures degradation patterns that emerge over time

**Alternative Considered:** Random stratified split (not suitable for time-series data)

### Why Compute Features Inside API?

**Decision:** API accepts raw inputs and computes features on-the-fly instead of requiring pre-computed features

**Rationale:**
- **Consistency:** Same feature computation logic used during training and inference
- **Simplicity:** Clients send raw sensor values; API handles transformation
- **Flexibility:** Easy to update feature logic without client changes
- **Portability:** Models remain self-contained with their feature requirements

**Trade-off:** Slight latency increase (typically <50ms for single prediction); mitigated by batch endpoint for bulk requests.

## 🚀 Optional Cloud Deployment (Hugging Face Spaces)

This project has also been deployed on Hugging Face Spaces as a Dockerized FastAPI service for demonstration purposes.

### Live URLs

**Health check:**
```
GET https://jhapiyush44-tensor-dpf-telementry-ml.hf.space/health
```

**Swagger UI:**
```
https://jhapiyush44-tensor-dpf-telementry-ml.hf.space/docs
```

### Current Status

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `GET /health` | ✅ Works | API running |
| `GET /model/info` | ✅ Works | Model metadata available |
| `POST /predict/soot-load` | ⚠ May fail | Model training during build exceeds memory |
| `POST /predict/batch` | ⚠ May fail | Same reason |

### Why POST endpoints may fail

During Docker build, the container:
- Generates synthetic data (~3.9M rows)
- Performs feature engineering (rolling windows, groupby ops)
- Trains RandomForest models

This requires >4GB RAM.

The free Hugging Face Spaces environment has limited memory, so the training step may be killed by the system:
- Exit code 137 (OOMKilled)

As a result, models are not created and prediction endpoints return:
```
503 Models not loaded
```

**This does NOT affect local usage:**
- Locally: Full dataset, full training, all endpoints work correctly
- The issue is only related to limited cloud build resources

### 🔧 How to enable POST endpoints on Hugging Face (if needed)

If deployment with working predictions is required, apply these steps:

**Step 1 — Reduce dataset size for container training**

In `generate_data.py`, use environment variables:
```python
N_VEHICLES = 5
DAYS = 14
FREQ = "5min"
```

This reduces memory usage by ~100x.

**Step 2 — Reduce training cost**

In `models/train.py`:
```python
n_estimators = 20
n_jobs = 1
```

Prevents parallel memory spikes.

**Step 3 — Train models during Docker build**

Add to `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
RUN python data_generation/generate_data.py && \
    python pipeline/feature_engineering.py && \
    python models/train.py
```

This generates models inside the container so POST endpoints work.

**After these changes:**
- Models load successfully
- POST endpoints return predictions
- Space runs fully end-to-end
